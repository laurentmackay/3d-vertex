General
- Precompilation (cache=True is good enough for now)
- Figure out why some intercalating edges dont get displayed
- Double check all the edge properties during intercalation resolution





Viz:
- Dynamic title (e.g., for displaying time)
- controls to manipulate kwargs?
- abitrary function for scalars?
